# taoteching

the taoteching is an ancient book of chinese philosophy. It uses simple language and is structured in short verses.
In fact it's accessible enough even for a child to read. As was the case for me, when I first read it.
I remember using my dad's computer while he had set it as his homepage for some time.
For the most part I ignored it on my journey to other parts of the internet but I remember being in awe the when I actually sat down and read it.
For this reason a particular rendition of the text is highly nostalgic to me.  


Although I tried several times across the years to track down the original version I first read I came up empty handed.
I managed to find many online versions of the source material with different translations and styling but none were the one I was looking for.
I remember it best for it's strikingly simple presentation. In fact had been entirely unstyled HTML - striking black text against a white background.
Because I believe that this style of presentation fits the tone and content of the book, as well as because of it's sentimental presence in my mind,
I decided to recreate the effect that the original page had with it's plain design.

At this point in time I am studying web development so it seems a natural exercise.
however, after running a quick search of `taoteching` on github I found it, right here: https://github.com/MarxBro/taoteching  
is that it, story over? not quite. while I am very happy to find the original that eluded me for so long and seemed all but dissapeared from the internet,
I was immediately able to critique to presentation. It was aligned to the extreme left of the the screen and on my modern monitor the size of text was unimpressive.
It renders poorly on small mobile screens.  

## TLDR

this repo is my attempt to restyle the an old page displaying the taoteching. It address my concerns with readability and layout, and
hopes to improve on the presentation while leaving a similar impression to the original.
Because of my history with the text, the contents of the HTML remain entirely unchanged.
